By emphasizing 'faith alone,' the LCMS affirms that righteousness before God is granted solely through believing in Christ, not by anything we do, ensuring that all glory belongs to God."

This belief teaches that humans cannot earn salvation through their own efforts, works, or merits. Instead, it is through God's unearned grace, made known to us through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, that forgiveness and eternal life are offered to all who believe. This foundational truth highlights God's unconditional love and serves as a cornerstone of faith within the LCMS."
